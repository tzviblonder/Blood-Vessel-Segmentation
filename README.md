# Blood Vessel Segmentation

#### The human body could be observed and studied through many different perspectives and on various levels, such as a collection of organs, a system of muscles and limbs, or a network of nerve endings and synapses. One of the most critical and difficult of these is at the cellular level - a perspective of our bodies that looks at dozens of trillions of individual cells. Creating this would require a Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to serve as a roadmap to navigate the locations of cells across the body. One approach is called Vascular Common Coordinate Framework (VCCF), which uses the human vasculature (arrangement of blood vessels) to define "addresses" for our trillions of cells. These defined positions can be entire organs, tissue units, or individual cells.
#### Creating this system is challenging because of the difficulty and tediousness in manually tracing vasculature structures. This leases to gaps in what researchers know. Instead, machine learning can take over that process. This algorithm looks at images of kidneys and determines the location of blood vessels within them.
